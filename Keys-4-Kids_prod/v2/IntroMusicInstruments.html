							  <h25>Week 1-3: Acoustics</h25>
							  <p>What is sound, and how does it work? Students will conduct experiments to explore how sounds are produced. We will learn the basics of the piano, note names, range, pitch, basic rhythm patterns, and playing melodies. Students will begin reading music and getting familiarized with music notation and solfege.</p>

							<div class="timelinecontent">
							  <h25>Week 4-7: String instruments</h25>
							  <p>Students will learn the history about every family of string instruments (bowed, plucked, struck strings, etc.), their similarities and differences, and the basic elements of playing each type of string instrument (posture, sound production, correct technique, etc.). Classes will also include coordination games, pitch recognition on various string instruments, and categorizing every member of each family based on the range of the respective instrument.</p>

						  <div class="timelinecontainer tright">
							<div class="timelinecontent">
							  <h25>Week 8-9: Percussion instruments</h25>
							  <p>Students will learn about the origins of percussion, sound production, and the basic techniques of playing drums. They will review pitch and apply what they have learned to percussion with a focus on rhythm and learning different patterns. They will copy rhythms and follow rhythmic notation first as a group and then as individuals. Strings, piano, and drums will be combined into one ensemble, and students will learn how to play in a group setting.</p>

						  <div class="timelinecontainer tright">
							<div class="timelinecontent">
							  <h25>Week 11-12: Wind instruments</h25>
							  <p>We will first learn how wind instruments produce sound. We will then build simple wind instruments and categorize the major families, being able to produce a sound on a few different types of mouthpieces (trumpet, clarinet, flute etc.). Students will apply elements of pitch and rythm to their new skills with wind instruments. Some wind instruments will then join the ensemble.</p>

						  <div class="timelinecontainer tright">
							<div class="timelinecontent">
							  <h25>Week 13-16: The voice and electronic instruments</h25>
							  <p>With an emphasis on synthesizers, audio recording, and effects, students will learn basic recording techniques for each type of instrument presented so far. Finally, students will make and record songs using concepts from each unit.</p>
