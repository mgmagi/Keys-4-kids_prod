						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>The Keys for Kids® program is designed to take advantage of children’s remarkable ability to develop musical skills at an early age – and have lots of fun in the process! In our signature piano classes children develop a wide range of musical proficiencies that would be useful for any instrument they may later choose. We use keyboard to teach music fundamentals, to encourage concrete and immediate comprehension of otherwise abstract music theory and music notation skills. Keys for Kids does all this in a fun, interactive, social, and encouraging environment that teaches leadership, teamwork, and establishes a lifelong appreciation of music.<br><br>Students from ages 3 to 12 follow a sequence of well-defined progression of musical concepts and skills appropriate to their age and abilities (see the Curriculum below for moredetails). There is always a good place to start, regardless of age or past experience. </p>

								<p>Compared to traditional private piano lessons Keys for Kids curriculum is all-inclusive and comprehensive. While classes are taught on the piano keyboard, children develop a wide range of musical skills and knowledge that will be useful for any instrument they may later choose. We use keyboard to teach music fundamentals, to encourage concrete and immediate comprehension of otherwise rather abstract music theory and music notation skills. Children sing solfege, move to music, play rhythm instruments, play the piano keyboard (solo and ensemble), and join in a broad variety of music appreciation activities (ear training, music theory, music history and analysis, music notation, composition, etc.).</p>

						<h2>Teeny Keys (ages 3.5-4.5)</h2>
						<p>This program will jump start your child’s journey of musical learning. Children develop their imagination through immersion in rich and varied array of listening activities, singing, rhythm instruments, and expressive movement. Through carefully planned activities children are introduced to music in a positive and enjoyable way while beginning to learn to read rhythms, musical symbols, and basics of music notation. Children develop confidence in their skills and musical ability, learn piano geography and play simple short songs on the piano. Initial keyboard playing activities engage the use of large motor skills appropriate to this stage of their physical development. Child and parent bond as a music team in class and at home.</p>
