								<p>I joined my daughter into Kinder Keys 1 class after hearing wonderful comments about Inga’s teaching style from my own Indian classical music students.</p>
								<p>Inga embodies the elements of an excellent music teacher, and inspires the children in her class to succeed. She gives great focus on all the important elements: good fingering, posture, attitude, respect (for the teacher, class and the music), and love for the music itself.  Her encouragement to all students to practice is both strict, and goal-oriented, but with lots of positive reinforcement as students’ progress. She has taken the complex theory of classical music and linked it to stories that children can easily remember and apply: in short, she has made it fun!  I look forward to joining my son in her program as well, and thank her immensely for the sincere guidance she is providing my daughter.</p>
								<p>As a music teacher myself, I have such respect for her approach and interaction style with her students. Her program is one that I would encourage parents to seriously consider.</p>

									<p>Keys for Kids was a fabulous way for my son to learn how to play piano in a fun way. As a parent, I appreciated being a part of the group classes and having the knowledge to support my child practicing at home. I was impressed by the creative and innovative lesson plans to make theory, ear training and playing come to life.</p>

									<p>I started in Keys for Kids eleven years ago when I was in kindergarten. I loved the classes and later on my private piano lessons at the studio. Now I’m 16, devote much of my free time to my musical activities, and my high school music theory teacher thinks I’m “a genius.”  Thank you Inga!</p>

									<p>We love Keys for Kids! The curriculum is very effective and kid-friendly. With this method, our children have quickly learned how to play the piano...and it's been fun along the way! It integrates music theory with the practice, so our children are becoming literate, thinking musicians. They can analyze and understand the pieces they play. This program develops the fingers and the brain, giving our three children a solid foundation in piano practice and music theory for a life time.</p>
